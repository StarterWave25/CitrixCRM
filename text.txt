Expenses:
-When ever manager clicks on the expenses button for an specific employee. This page should open expenses.html?empId=xx.
-We have implemented the expenses.html for employee at @employee/expenses.html . So, take the code everything functionality and styles from @styles/employee/expenses.css and @scripts/employee/expenses.js.
-We used empId to get expenses of a particular employee through id in userDetails in localStorgar. So, instead of that use empId in url parameter.
